# GOB Development Worklogs

This directory contains detailed development session logs for the GOB (General Orchestrator Bot) project.

## Purpose

Each worklog documents significant development sessions and major commits, providing:
- **Historical Context** - What was accomplished and why
- **Technical Details** - Implementation decisions and changes made
- **Impact Assessment** - How changes improve the project
- **Future Planning** - Next steps and identified opportunities

## Naming Convention

Worklogs follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Examples:
- `2025-09-06-project-reorganization.md`
- `2025-09-07-authentication-system.md`
- `2025-09-10-api-enhancements.md`

## Structure Template

Each worklog includes:

1. **Header Information**
   - Date, commit hash, branch, developer
   - Session duration and scope

2. **Objectives Completed**
   - Major features and improvements implemented
   - Problems solved and solutions applied

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Developer experience improvements
   - Code maintainability enhancements
   - Operational benefits

4. **Technical Details**
   - File changes summary
   - Key technical decisions
   - Testing and validation performed

5. **Next Steps**
   - Future development opportunities
   - Identified technical debt
   - Planning insights

## Usage

### For Developers
- Review before working on related features
- Understand historical decisions and context
- Learn from previous implementation approaches

### For Project Management
- Track development velocity and progress
- Understand technical debt accumulation
- Plan future development priorities

### For Documentation
- Reference for architectural decisions
- Historical context for code reviews
- Onboarding material for new contributors

## Maintenance

- Create a new worklog for each significant commit/feature
- Update existing logs if follow-up work is done
- Keep technical details accurate and implementation-focused
- Focus on impact and decision rationale over code details
